Assignment 3
Lighting and Textures

Compile this program with the 'make clean' and 'make' commands

Image of rendered chess board in Chess_Board.jpg

Use openGL to render a 3D scene that uses both lighting and textures

User Control:
	escape key - close the program
	Number '0' - Reset to original view
	'u' - Raise the position of the light
	'j' -  Lower the position of the light
	'<' - Move the light source clockwise
	'>' - Move the light source counterclockwise
	'm' = Toggle automatic rotation of light source
	
	Angles of the view controlled by the arrow keys
	
Additional Information:
	This assignment built significantly on the project for the second week.  
	Instead of randomly throwing pieces around the scene, chess pieces are 
	now placed on oposing sides of a chess board.  I included face-culling to
	speed up rendering.  I also decreased the number of polygons in spheres 
	and cylindrical bases.  This makes the pieces appear more geometric than 
	organic.  However, the rendering the scene is faster and the textures
	look better, so it was a worthy compromise.
